<mark style="background-color: #FFFFC0"> I am starting a new position as a senior silicon photonics design engineer at Alpine Optoelectronics. </mark>

I am a Ph.D. at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/), working with Prof. [Ray T. Chen](http://www.ece.utexas.edu/people/faculty/ray-chen) and [David Z. Pan](http://www.ece.utexas.edu/~dpan/).
Previously, I received a B.S. degree in Physics from [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/main.psp), in 2018.

My area of interest includes silicon photonics, design, simulation, and testing of integrated photonic chips for high-performance computing and interconnect, and electronic photonic design automation.
<!-- My current research interests include machine learning, algorithm and architecture design for AI acceleration, software/hardware co-design for optical neuromorphic computing,  and GPU acceleration for VLSI physical design automation. -->
