## **Research Experience**
* **University of Texas at Austin, USA**
  * Research Assistant, ECE department, University of Texas at Austin, Sept 2018 - Present, Austin, TX
  * **Photonic neural chip：** Worked on photonic neural chip tape-out for novel optical neural network(ONN) architectures using Advanced Micro Foundry (AMF); collaborated on the full-stack schematic design, layout, validation, tape-out of photonic neural chips using Lumerical Interconnect, Synopsys optodesigner, and PyTorch. Testing the performance of the photonic neural chip.
  * **Electronic-photonic digital computing chip：** Worked on electronic-photonic digital computing chip tape-out for photonic logic functional units using AIM photonics; worked on the design, layout, validation, tape-out, performance evaluation, and high-speed measurement of the digital computing circuits. Proposed and experimentally demonstrated the photonic version of comparator, multiplexer/demultiplexer and decoder.
  * **Electronic-photonic digital full adder:** Collaborated on the architecture design, high-speed measurement, and performance evaluation of an electronic-photonic full adder fabricated by AIM photonics. Collaborated on proposing the idea of electronic-photonic arithmetic logic unit.
  * **Modeling of Silicon photonic modulators：** Investigated high-speed properties of the microresonator-based modulators and evaluated their effects on optical digital computing. Provided the solutions to increase the optical bandwidth of the microresonator-based modulators and the accuracy of the optical computing circuits.
  * Collaborated on the design, validation, and tapeout of photonic recurrent neural networks using PyTorch, Lumerical toolkits, and Synopsys optodesigner
  * Collaborated on developing GPU-accelerated concurrent VLSI detailed placement with CUDA; implemented and optimized global swap and parallel auction algorithm for batched-based independent-set-matching; achieved >10x speedup than sequential implementations without quality degradation
  * Collaborated on high-performance VLSI analytical global placement acceleration with CUDA on GPUs; optimized wirelength and density computation operators with CUDA; developed parallel RUDY/RISA congestion map for routability optimization; achieved 40x speedup in global placement
  * Developed multi-electrostatics-based robust VLSI placement algorithm with PyTorch/C++/CUDA; proposed multi-electrostatic system for optimization under fence region constraints; developed divergence-aware optimizer for robust nonlinear global placement; achieved >13% HPWL improvement and >11% top5 overflow reduction compared with ISPD2015 contest winners


* **Nanjing, Nanjing, China**
  * Undergraduate research student, College of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Nanjing University, May 2016 - July 2018, Nanjing, China
