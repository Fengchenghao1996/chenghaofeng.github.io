## **Work Experience**
* **Meta Platforms, USA, USA**
  * Hardware Engineer Intern, Meta infrastructure, Network Hardware Engineering team, May 2022 - Aug 2022, Menlo park, CA
  * **Intern manager:** Thang Pham. **Hiring manager:** James Stewart 
  * **High-speed electrical host compliance test：** Worked on module stressed input tests for 2x400G optical modules
  * **Sipho device design:** Built a fully-automated design flow to run FDTD/MODE simulations on Lumerical using Python APIs. Designed photonic devices using foundry process files.
  * **2x400G module HTX setting:** Worked on unifying host TX settings for 2x400G optical modules.   


## **Research Experience**
* **University of Texas at Austin, USA**
  * Research Assistant, ECE department, University of Texas at Austin, Sept 2018 - Present, Austin, TX
  * **Photonic neural chip：** Worked on photonic neural chip tape-out for novel optical neural network(ONN) architectures using Advanced Micro Foundry (AMF); collaborated on the full-stack schematic design, layout, validation, tape-out of photonic neural chips using Lumerical Interconnect, Synopsys optodesigner, and PyTorch. Testing the performance of the photonic neural chip.
  * **Electronic-photonic digital computing chip：** Worked on electronic-photonic digital computing chip tape-out for photonic logic functional units using AIM photonics; worked on the design, layout, validation, tape-out, performance evaluation, and high-speed measurement of the digital computing circuits. Proposed and experimentally demonstrated the photonic version of comparator, multiplexer/demultiplexer and decoder.
  * **Electronic-photonic digital full adder:** Collaborated on the architecture design, high-speed measurement, and performance evaluation of an electronic-photonic full adder fabricated by AIM photonics. Collaborated on proposing the idea of electronic-photonic arithmetic logic unit.
  * **Modeling of Silicon photonic modulators：** Investigated high-speed properties of the microresonator-based modulators and evaluated their effects on optical digital computing. Provided the solutions to increase the optical bandwidth of the microresonator-based modulators and the accuracy of the optical computing circuits.
  


* **Nanjing, Nanjing, China**
  * Undergraduate research student, College of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Nanjing University, May 2016 - July 2018, Nanjing, China
