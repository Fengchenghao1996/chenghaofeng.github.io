## **Research Experience**
* **University of Texas at Austin, USA**
  * Research Assistant, ECE department, University of Texas at Austin, Sept 2018 - Present, Austin, TX
  * **Photonic neural chip：** Worked on photonic neural chip tape-out for novel optical neural network(ONN) architectures using Advanced Micro Foundry (AMF); collaborated on the full-stack schematic design, layout, validation, tape-out of photonic neural chips using Lumerical Interconnect, Synopsys optodesigner, and PyTorch. Testing the performance of the photonic neural chip.
  * **Electronic-photonic digital computing chip：** Worked on electronic-photonic digital computing chip tape-out for photonic logic functional units using AIM photonics; worked on the design, layout, validation, tape-out, performance evaluation, and high-speed measurement of the digital computing circuits. Proposed and experimentally demonstrated the photonic version of comparator, multiplexer/demultiplexer and decoder.
  * **Electronic-photonic digital full adder:** Collaborated on the architecture design, high-speed measurement, and performance evaluation of an electronic-photonic full adder fabricated by AIM photonics. Collaborated on proposing the idea of electronic-photonic arithmetic logic unit.
  * **Modeling of Silicon photonic modulators：** Investigated high-speed properties of the microresonator-based modulators and evaluated their effects on optical digital computing. Provided the solutions to increase the optical bandwidth of the microresonator-based modulators and the accuracy of the optical computing circuits.
  


* **Nanjing, Nanjing, China**
  * Undergraduate research student, College of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Nanjing University, May 2016 - July 2018, Nanjing, China
  * **Arbitrary Complex Brag Grating Waveguide:** Developed and optimized codes to design the arbitrary complex Brag grating waveguide using inverse-design algorithms. Improved the simulation time complexity and scale down the size of the structure. Improved the simulation accuracy.
